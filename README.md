# AliexpressOrders
Now track your own aliexpress orders easily. This python script generates a json representation of all your orders. It also saved the information in a google sheet if you have set up one. 

This will enable you to use powerful spreadsheet filters in google sheets for better order manageent and tracking

### Usage
Get only screenshot:
`python aliexpress.py screenshot <screenshot_filename.png>`

Get only order details in json format:
`python aliexpress.py json`

Get both screenshot and order details:
`python aliexpress.py json,screenshot <screenshot_filename.png>`

### Whats working
1. Awaiting Shipments orders details
2. Awaiting Delivery Order details
3. Order Completed details
4. Orders pending payment details
3. Implement pagination for the above sections such that more than 10 orders per section appears
4. Implement google sheet integration
5. Implement batch google sheet update (Now update to google sheets is much faster - 20s for 200 plus orders)
6. Order tracking ID integrated. Also, the last package delivery status for the tracking id is retrieved
7. Scraps in background, tested with both chromium and firefox headless
8. Saves screenshot of the orders page in png format
